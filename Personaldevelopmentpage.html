	<h1 style = "text-align:left; color:white; font-size:40px"><i><u>Creativity</u></i></h1>
	
	 <p style = "text-align: left; color:white ">My creativity has always been good, but I've been improving the skills I hold over the years. I think it's necessary to have an open mind about the world and the beauty each and everything possesses. Creativity is one of the world's most important human resources. it is necessary to move forward with new and improved ideas. this progress has always been important to me and the world. To create something is so simple that's why it is so hard. this assignment is just like that, using just the basic HTML is like ABC but also like spelling the hardest word in the world. I think that if it hadn't been for the skills and creativeness that I have now I wouldn't be able to get this assignment done.

	<h1 style = "text-align:right; color:white; font-size:40px"><i><u>Determination</u></i></h1>
	<p style = "text-align: right; color:white ">My success means everything to me. I am determined to get there no matter the obstacles laid in the way. I believe that with determination you can get through anything.  Having the courage to become the person you believe you were meant to be is driven by that strong will.  Failure surrounds us like the air we breathe, the habit of quitting hits us on a regular basis but if we stand strong and stay determined nothing will ever be able to stop us. Over the last couple of years, the determination I hold has gotten me through hell and back it has given me a whole new view of temporary situations in life.

	<h1 style = "text-align:left; color:white; font-size:40px"><i><u>Respect</u></i></h1>
	   <p style = "text-align: left; color:white ">My respect is taller than the Blue Mountains Peak.  Respect plays a role in everyone's everyday life, it is shown to my coworkers, family friends, and even strangers. To move forward in life and build an important connection for the future you will most definitely need this asset in your life. This will bring success in many different ways, also having respect for yourself is very important. This is important to a person because it can be the balancing factor of your life. It builds self-esteem which gives you the courage to stand tall when needs are. I have a lot of respect, this is the way I was grown from an early age, and I still find ways to improve on this each and every day when I'm out in the world experience what it has to offer.

	<h1 style = "text-align:right; color:white; font-size:40px"><i><u>Summary of The Book Twelve Pillars Chapter 4-7</u></i></h1>
	   <p style = "text-align: left; color:white "> To set goals will guide you and open your mind to getting to a point in the future where you want to be. The pain of regret and discipline are common among all; stated earlier pain, we would rather not experience either. To help guide us from such experience we should set certain standards. To have friends that you are used to which have already met your expectations is easier than to make new ones that come with everything new. However, people who strive for success and achieve it usual tend to look for people similar to themselves. This pushes them and help them to become better. A lot of people don’t go out and learn how to grow and become more than they are. If you’re to separate from everyone make sure you are focused on continuous learning. It is where wealth begins.
This is an easy implementation to be added to my life because I have been practicing and learning while I grow and it has given my life a new and exciting look.
